# HomeAssets
Manage informative cards about home services as:
- *Electrical service*
- *Gas service*
- *Water supply service*
- *And internet*

## Run HomeAssets in a docker + docker-compose platform.
### .env
You need to create a ".env" file with the following environment variables:

> **POSTGRES_USER**=*value1*
> **POSTGRES_PASSWORD**=*value2*
> **POSTGRES_DB**=*value3* 
> **CS**=Host=db;Port=5432;Database=*value3*;Username=*value1*;Password=*value2*
> **From**=*value4*
> **MailServer**=*value5*
> **MailUsername**=*value6*
> **MailPassword**=*value7*

### How to fill .env:
- Credentials "*value1*", "*value2*" and "*value3*" should be change by you to what you consider best secure values for the database.
- "*value4*" should be a mail address inside your mailserver that you can use e.g. *username@jdevops.xyz*
- "*value5*", "*value6*" and "*value7*" are data inherent to the mail server that you will use.

### Do not change:
- Value db Is the name given to the database service inside the docker-compose file.
- The database runs locally in the default postgres port 5432 but outside the container you can connect it through the 55342 port (see docker-compose.yml file).

### Important considerations:
- If you change POSTGRES_USER to a different value that is not the default postgres user, you have to replace into the init_schema.sh file the statements "Owner: postgres" to "Owner: value1". Where value1 is the value you set inside the .env file.
- The example domain used in this project is jdevops.xyz. You have to update this name with an appropiate domain.

### Add the TLS certificate and key:
- Add the https certificate inside a folder called https in the root path.
- If you want to read your certificate from other location, you should update the volumes part in the docker-compose.yml file. 

### Run with docker-compose.
Next, you can run the docker-compose file with the following command:

    sudo docker-compose up -d

And check the HomeAssets webapp in the port 80 or 443 of your browser.
